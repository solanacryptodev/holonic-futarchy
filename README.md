# The Holonic Futarchy Program

This program establishes the creation of a holarchy-based DAO, along with individual Holons
that can be their own semi-autonomous futarchies.

It is a work-in-progress in its current state.

## Holarchy
A hierarchy of holons is called a holarchy. The branches of a holarchy are the channels of communication or the flow of information between several holons that are related to each other. A Holon is a node in the structure of a hierarchy that addresses the ambiguity between part and whole. In a Solana program, these holons are accounts.

## Holonic Futarchy
A holonic futarchy will allow for the creation of DAOs and proposals based off of The Meta-DAOs Autocrat program. Each DAO will be a separate holon, but the program will allow for non-futarchical holons as well.

The root holon serves as the base for the entire organizational structure and is the first created via a multisig approval. All child holons created then reference the root.

I initially wrote about this concept across two Medium articles...

## What It Does (WIP - Ideation Phase Ongoing)

1. Allows for the creation of a multi signature account that can be used to approve transactions based on a threshold being met.
2. Allows for the creation of a root Holarchy PDA.
3. Allows for the creation of Holons that have the option of being futarchies.

### Future Extensions

1. Allow for users to have the ability to join a Holon.
2. Holon-to-Holon Communication: there are use cases to allow for this. Could be done using a Message System and/or Event Subscriptions. Would be cool to have real-time communication between holon accounts.
3. Users: a lot could be done with users. Could add custom privileges, rankings, etc.
