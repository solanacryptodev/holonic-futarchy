# The Holonic Futarchy Program (WIP)

This program establishes the creation of a holarchy-based DAO, along with individual Holons
that can be their own semi-autonomous futarchies.

It is a work-in-progress in its current state.

## What It Does

1. Allows for the creation of a multi signature account that can be used to approve transactions based on a threshold being met.
2. Allows for the creation of a root Holarchy PDA.
3. Allows for the creation of Holons that have the option of being futarchies.

### Potential Extensions

1. Allow for users to have the ability to join a Holon.
2. Holon-to-Holon Communication: there are use cases to allow for this. Could be done using a Message System and/or Event Subscriptions. Would be cool to have real-time communication between holon accounts.
3. Users: a lot could be done with users. Could add custom privileges, rankings, etc.
